iaq_desc: "IAQ (Index of Air Quality) is a comprehensive index that measures the concentration of harmful organic compounds and other pollutants affecting health and comfort. The scale ranges from 0 (clean air) to 500 (heavily polluted air), where values above 200 indicate poor air quality that may cause respiratory issues and discomfort."
voc_desc: "Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) indicate the presence of airborne organic substances, such as emissions from paint, furniture, or organic waste, as well as those generated by cooking, human activity, and animals. Elevated VOC levels often signal unpleasant odors. According to guidelines from the German Federal Environmental Agency, exceeding 25 mg/m³ of total VOC have neurotoxic effects on health."
co2_desc: "Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is naturally present, but higher concentrations can lower productivity, impair cognitive function, and negatively impact well-being, especially by disrupting sleep quality. At dangerously high levels, it becomes toxic and can lead to serious health issues or even death. "
